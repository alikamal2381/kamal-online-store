          Adidas shoes help get you on track for whatever you have in mind.
          Whether you are heading to the gym, to the mall, or out to lunch with
          your friends, your adidas are always more than up for the challenge.
          At Rack Room Shoes, we carry an extensive selection of adidas shoes
          for men, women, and kids – including the iconic adidas Grand Court and
          adidas Lite Racer – so you can show off your sense of style and good
          taste with a new pair of kicks from the largest sportswear
          manufacturer in Europe. Founded by brothers Adolf and Rudolf Dassler
          in their mother’s house in Germany in 1924, the Dassler Brothers Shoe
          Factory (which would later go on to be renamed adidas), specialized in
          the development of spiked running shoes for athletic events. Over
          time, the heavy shoes with metal spikes would give way to more
          lightweight canvas and rubber materials. The brand achieved notoriety
          after U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens wore a pair of Dassler handmade spikes
          at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Today, the “Three Stripes Company” has
          branched out their product line well beyond athletic shoes, offering a
          wide array of additional footwear, clothing, accessories, and
          lifestyle products. Adidas has a long history of making some of the
          world’s most popular shoes. Few shoes give you the balance of
          performance and style like the adidas Questar Flow. Available in a
          wide range of colors and styles for men, women, and kids, adidas
          Questar sneakers keep your feet feeling fresh and comfy, no matter
          what you’re up to or for how long you plan to be at it. At Rack Room
          Shoes, we have the right adidas shoes for every look and occasion. We
          carry adidas slides, sandals, sneakers, running shoes, and more, with
          sizes available for adults, and plenty of adidas shoes for kids, too.
          With adidas on your feet, you can be your best self – and look your
          best no matter where you are. Be brave, be bold, and create the new in
          your adidas today.
